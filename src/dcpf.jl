    # DCPF  Solves a DC power flow.
    # Solves for the bus voltage angles at all but the reference bus, given the full system
    # B matrix and the vector of bus real power injections, the initial
    # vector of bus voltage angles (in radians), and column vectors with
    # the lists of bus indices for the swing bus, PV buses, and PQ buses,
    # respectively. Returns a vector of bus voltage angles in radians.
